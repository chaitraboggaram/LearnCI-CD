## Creating Pull Request Template

1. **Create a folder named `.github` in the main folder**:
   - This folder will hold GitHub-related files for the repository.

2. **Create a file named `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`**:
   - This file will serve as the template for pull requests.

3. **Type the content for the template and commit your changes to the `main` branch**:
   - Customize the template to include sections such as description, checklist, guidelines, or anything else relevant to your project.

4. **To test, create a new branch**:
   - Follow these steps:
     - Click on the "Branch: main" dropdown button on the repository's main page.
     - Type in the name for your new branch in the text box provided. This could be something related to the feature or fix you're working on.
     - Press Enter or click on the "Create branch: your-branch-name" button.

5. **Now, click on Pull Requests and Create Pull Request**:
   - You should be able to see the template that you provided in `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` automatically populated in the description field.

This process ensures consistency and provides useful information when contributors open pull requests.
